Team name: FuelWatch

Industry/Audience: 
Wildfire Management & Emergency Response
→ USFS, State Fire Agencies, Insurance Companies

Solution summary: 
We update wildfire fuel maps WEEKLY using free satellite data 
instead of every 2-3 years, helping fire managers identify 
high-risk areas before fire season starts. Validated on a $4B 
wildfire: 43% improvement over current government standards.

Impact:
Better pre-season planning → Prioritized fuel treatments → 
Fewer catastrophic fires → Lives and billions saved
