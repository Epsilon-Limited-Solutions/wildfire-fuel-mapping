# Quick Reference Card - Keep This Handy During Pitch

## The Hook (Memorize This)
"LANDFIRE updates fuel maps every 2-3 years. Wildfires don't wait. We fixed that with weekly satellite updates - proven on a $4 billion wildfire with 43% improvement."

## Key Numbers (Memorize These)
- **43.1%** - Improvement over LANDFIRE baseline
- **341,735 acres** - Hermits Peak fire size
- **$4 billion** - Damage from one fire
- **2.5 million** - Pixel sample size for validation
- **25.6%** - High stress areas detected
- **46%** - Mean fuel load increase
- **$80 billion** - Annual US wildfire costs
- **50,000+** - Wildfires per year in US
- **FREE** - All satellite data costs
- **< $1,000/year** - Operational costs

- ✅ Confident delivery
- ✅ Real data, not promises
→ Practice timing, stay calm

**Creativity (15 pts)**:
- ✅ Novel combination (LANDFIRE + satellites)
- ✅ Obvious in hindsight
- ✅ Solves real pain point
→ "Satellites are already there, we just connected dots"

**Expert Taste (10 pts)**:

## Opening Line
"Hi, I'm [Name]. Every year, the US spends billions fighting wildfires using fuel maps that are 2-3 years out of date. I'm going to show you how we fixed that - and proved it worked on a real $4 billion wildfire."

## Closing Line
"Every year between LANDFIRE updates, conditions change. Every year, fires get worse. We can't wait 2-3 years for better data. The satellites are overhead right now. Let's use them. Thank you."

## If Tech Fails
"Let me show you screenshots of the working system..." [Have backup images ready]

## Key Message Per Slide
1. **Title**: We update fuel maps weekly, not yearly
2. **Problem**: $4B fire, 2-year-old map = disaster
3. **Why Fail**: Satellites fly daily, LANDFIRE updates every 2-3 years
4. **Solution**: LANDFIRE + weekly satellites = better maps
5. **Validation**: 43% improvement, statistically proven ⭐⭐⭐
6. **Impact**: Better targeting = billions saved
7. **Tech**: Free data, scales nationwide
8. **Demo**: It's real, it works, it's live
9. **Next**: Need pilot partner, ready to deploy
10. **Close**: Can't wait, satellites are ready, let's go

## Anticipated Questions - Quick Answers

**"Why haven't agencies done this?"**
→ Lack resources and expertise. We offer turnkey solution.

**"How accurate really?"**
→ 2.5M pixels, p < 0.001, 43% improvement. Happy to share full methodology.

**"What about clouds?"**
→ Composite over 2 weeks, multiple satellites. Standard remote sensing.

**"How do you make money?"**
→ Government contracts, insurance B2B, SaaS subscriptions.

**"Real-time during fires?"**
→ This is pre-season planning. Different but complementary to incident response.

**"Why not just AI?"**
→ Hybrid approach: physics-based models + satellite observations. More trusted, better performance.

## Body Language Reminders
- ✓ Stand tall, confident
- ✓ Eye contact with judges
- ✓ Hand gestures for emphasis
- ✓ Smile at victories (43%!)
- ✓ Slow down, breathe
- ✗ Don't pace nervously
- ✗ Don't apologize for UI

## Voice Reminders
- ✓ Project to back of room
- ✓ Vary tone for interest
- ✓ Emphasize KEY NUMBERS
- ✓ Pause for impact
- ✗ Don't rush
- ✗ Don't use filler words

## Time Checkpoints
- 1:00 - Should be on Slide 2 (Problem)
- 2:30 - Should be on Slide 4 (Solution)
- 4:00 - Should be on Slide 6 (Impact) or starting Demo
- 5:30 - Should be on Slide 9 (Next Steps)
- 6:30 - Done, ready for Q&A

## Emergency Backup
If you forget everything, remember this:
1. Fire managers use 2-year-old fuel maps
2. We update them weekly with satellites
3. Tested on real $4B fire: 43% better
4. Free data, ready to deploy
5. Satellites are flying now - let's use them

## Climate Connection (If Asked)
"Better fuel management → fewer catastrophic fires → less CO2 released. We're helping communities adapt to climate-driven fire conditions with weekly intelligence. Prevention, not just reaction."

## Your Unique Advantage
**You actually validated this on a real wildfire.**
Most hackathon projects are concepts. You have proof.
Lead with that. Own it. Be proud of it.
